= JekyllCommander

JekyllCommander is a Sinatra based web application, to give non-technical users
the ability to maintain a complex Jekyll website, including git version control,
without any scary terminal experiences.

JekyllCommander has been developed to fit exactly our needs. Some parts are
highly specific to our Website and our workflow. But maybe you can take some
advantage of this code, anyway.

We are thinking about changing JekyllCommander to be more generic, but you know:
Fork it, if we are to slow for you. ;)

== INSTALLATION AND USAGE

Will hopefully be written in the near future...
